Good luck!
As of 12th of March, DO NOT USE  Explorer's Notebook if you already have an exploration mission available or in progress, you WILL lose it. To put it simply, do one at a time.
A hotfix might be in the works.
Edit: Fixed in Patch 6.1.2 Hotfixes - April 21 - Explorer's Notebook or Garrison Scout Report used by players that already have an Exploration mission available should now be informed that they're not eligible for additional missions of that type and no longer incorrectly consume the item.

Note: you can have as many as you want in progress, but not inactive, so only use 1 explorer notebook, put mision on progress then use 1 more

You are totaly right on this. Had 5 missions left to do, went to use 20 restored artifacts for 4 notebooks then I did those 4 missions quest at the same time. Conclusion? I only got 1 done... beta testing again and again the game.. darn blizz

<h2 id="achi"> Achievement</h2> If you open a ticket, Blizz will restore the lost notebooks. They did for me.

Currently (Legion pre-patch), if you have an Exploration mission on your table that is not in-progress and try to use another notebook, it won't let you. It pops up a "You are not eligible for any new missions." You have to send followers out on the mission and have it underway before you can use another notebook.

So I needed this achievement for a while and was only missing 3 more, but the randomness made it really frustrating for me. I didn't really see anyone comment on this here, so I figure I post it here.

The way the books work now (at least from how I just tried it) based on what I read here is that in 6.2.2, you cannot use a notebook if you have a mission available to send out on your command table (though I didn't try to find out personally), BUT you can use a notebook to spawn a new mission if you sent one out already.

I bought 15 notebooks (all I had that I could buy at the time, since I did rely on some RNG to not mess me up, sinec buying 19 lets you have a stab at every possible mission), hearthed to my Garrison, and used notebooks one at a time. Over the course of 14 notebooks (spawned the 3rd one I needed on the 14th mission), I feel confident in saying that notebooks will never spawn a mission you already have in progress towards being completed when using a new notebook.
<p id="done">
 So I waited</p> until I had all 25 followers free, and sent them out one at a time until my command table looked like http://i.imgur.com/MO1Fxu7.jpg.

When I had my 3rd mission spawn on my 14th notebook, I used a scroll to instantly complete it (since it was at 94%, as the achievement only counts if you succeed) it, it succeeded, and then when I used my last notebook, it spawned the same 94% one (I see Dead Ogres) again as I presume it's probably the only non map mission that could still spawn for me currently. It's possible that it was probably just a coincidence, though. I also happened to have all of the Draenor archeology achievements except for the "collect all the pristines" achievement, if that helps with anything.

In any case, if you're happening to be missing 1-3 of these left and you're tired of the RNG of using a notebook one at a time, hopefully my suggestion on how to go about this mission as of my post (6.2.2) will help remove the randomness from this. Now I can use my restored artifacts while working on Draenor Curator to finish the MOP achievements I have left instead of this achievement.

Happy hunting all!

Not sure if i bugged it with buying treasure maps but Kaltheramis at blizzard told me to do the following to complete it 100%.</div>
